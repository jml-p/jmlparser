** TODO Implement ghost labels

  #+begin_src java
    //@ lbl: {}

    //@ lbl:
    a = x;
  #+end_src
  
  Ghost labels should be converted into JmlGhostLabelStmt, which
  should behave (except for printing) like a LabeledStmts. 
  
  Maybe we could reuse the original Java AST class and add a flag.
  
** REFERENCE `begin` and `end` markers for marking of blocks.
  This requires a special treatment and post-processor. 

  #+begin_src java
    //@ refine <contract>
    //@ begin
    int x = xxx;
    //@ end
  #+end_src

** REFERENCE Lambda Expressions
