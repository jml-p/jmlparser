# Development of JML Parser

## How To Compile Sources

If you checked out the project from GitHub you can build the project with maven using:

```
mvn clean install
```

If you checkout the sources and want to view the project in an IDE, it is best to first generate some of the source files; otherwise you will get many compilation complaints in the IDE. (mvn clean install already does this for you.)

```
mvn javacc:javacc
```

## Extending the AST

If you modify the code of the AST nodes, specifically if you add or remove fields or node classes,
the code generators will update a lot of code for you.
The `run_metamodel_generator.sh` script will rebuild the metamodel,
which is used by the code generators which are run by `run_core_generators.sh`
Make sure that `javaparser-core` at least compiles before you run these.

**Note**: for Eclipse IDE follow the steps described in the wiki: https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/wiki/Eclipse-Project-Setup-Guide
